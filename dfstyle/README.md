# DFStyle

NOTE: This is a crude port of https://github.com/Dozed12/df-style-worldgen to Go :)

All credit goes to the original author!

This modified version uses github.com/BigJk/ramen and github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten for rendering. There are also some really ugly ports of parts of libtcod in there somewhere... Which I probably should tidy up.

This is in really rough shape right now, but I will tidy things up as I go.

## TODO

- Fix river generation
- Add wars and war resolution
- Add record of history
