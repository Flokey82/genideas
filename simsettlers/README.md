# simsettlers

This is a WIP little procgen sim that simulates the growth of a small village. It is very crude at the moment and just operates on a square grid. In the future, building buildings will be tied to individuals and their resources, and plots can be expanded to include more than one tile. I just upload this current state since it does do something :)
