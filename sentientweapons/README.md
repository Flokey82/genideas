Binding souls to weapons, binding personality to stats :)

cursed specials actions:
- 1d8 extra damage at the cost of 1d10 damage to wielder (once per short rest? increase number of dice?)
- cast zone of truth by piercing the target with the weapon, does 2d10 necrotic damage to the target
- cast detect magic but wielder takes 1d10 psychic damage
- wielder gains darkvision but has roll a d20, on a 1 they are blinded for a day
- wielder gains advantage on perception checks but has disadvantage on all other checks
- weapon causes 1d10 elemental damage to wielder on a critical hit
- when drawn, creatures native to the weapon's plane of origin are drawn to the weapon and will try to take it from the wielder at all costs
- when drawn, the wielder must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to attack the nearest creature
- when out of initiative (after combat), the wielder must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to attack the nearest creature
- If a critical hit kills a target it is desintegrated, the wielder must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be take 1d10 necrotic damage.


The profession of the soul bound might have an influence on the effect:
Wizard: once per long rest cast detect magic
Farmer: advantage on nature checks or something really specific... advantage on milking a cow (or produce twice the milk)

I'd like the cursed variants with the "bad souls" or "innocent souls" bound by force to contain some substantial gamble that feels like "it's worth it" but can cause significant problems, even though they have stuff like extra fire damage or once free rage, etc.

Then what could be a way to "ethically source" souls? Volunteers? A seance and ask nicely? Does it cost a lot vs just binding a soul by force? What is the difference between sentient and "plain soulbound" weapons? Could you convince a cursed armor or weapon to give up the negative aspect if the bound soul is  of good alignment or "innocent"?

Could the binding process of voluntary souls be completely random and expensive, which makes it less interesting than the tempting "binding by force" that causes an item to be cursed?

Roll on table with personalities, roll on table of professions, roll on table with past deeds, determine the alignment and strength of the soul... roll a dice to determine what will determine the extra effect (personality, profession, deeds), roll on the relevant table?
