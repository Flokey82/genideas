# genideas

A whole bunch of half baked ideas. Nothing here works or is properly implemented.

Below are the only projects in here that are any good.

## dfstyle

This is a crude port of https://github.com/Dozed12/df-style-worldgen to Go :)

## gameoverworld

This is an experimental project experimenting with experimental ideas. It's a game, it's a world, it's a gameoverworld. :P

## gamestrategy

This is an experiment to create a simple (for now, zero-player) strategy game in order to experiment with different game mechanics and AI. Currently, this is just really bare bones and doesn't do much, but it's a start.

## gametiles

Tile based game example thingy (very rudimentary).

## genasciiparticles

Experiments with ASCII based particle systems, very basic and heavily WIP.
Right now, it just draws an area of effect around the mouse cursor and particles do not yet have any physics or bloom (lighting) effects.

## genpetscii

This is an experiment in drawing a map using an extended PETSCII character set. This is still a work in progress.

## genshops

genshops is a procedural generator implemented in Golang that enables you to effortlessly create captivating names and catchy slogans for shops and factions in your fantasy setting. With this tool, you can generate random, humorous names and slogans tailored to your preferences, adding a touch of whimsy to your world. At least that how ChatGPT would describe it.

Does aliteration like "Glorbnorb's glorious gear".

# noiserand

The `noiserand` package implements a random number generator that is based on multidimensional noise, using one of the dimensions as a seed, which allows slight alterations to the seed to slightly alter the generated sequence.
