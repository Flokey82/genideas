# genlandmarknames

This is a small library to generate random landmark names. It uses randomized pairs of words to generate the names.
At some point, I'll port this to my template based name / text generator, which will allow for more complex names.

It'll produce names like:

Swamps:
- The rotten phlegm of abandoned emperors
- The waterlogged swamp
- The stinking marsh of lost corpses
- The water-covered swamp
- The wet swamp of buried hope

Mountains:
- The steep rock of broken lovers
- The rocky spike
- The broken pinnacle of abandoned joy
- The rocky spur
- The broken spur of broken villains
- The rocky spike
- The toothy pinnacle of buried dreams
- The rough stone
- The steep thorn of lost emperors

Deserts:
- The desolate expanse
- The arid wasteland of lost lords
- The bleak desert
- The desolate region of burned tranquility
- The arid expanse
- The bleak desert of lost kings
- The burnt wasteland

Rivers:
- clear brooklet of sunken hope
- coolriver
- snaking run of flushed calm
- shimmeringriver
- swift brooklet of abandoned emperors
- snaking current
- fast brook of forgotten dreams
- fast current
- running waters of flushed love
- cleancurrent
- sparkling brook of sunken lords
- ripplingriver

... and so on. It's pretty basic, but it's a start.


Please feel free to contribute to the name lists! :)
