# simciv

Should be a stupid simple simulation of a civilization spreading and founding new colonies and cities and all that.

This is an idea to explore how to best implement an estimator for "how many thousand years does it take until a species has spread to the entire planet"... maybe how conflict may arise, how neighbors fight, how empires are built and how they fall.
