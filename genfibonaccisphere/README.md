Sure, here is a short Readme.md for the package:

# FibonacciSphere

This package provides a lightweight and efficient implementation for generating and working with Fibonacci spheres. Unlike traditional methods that require pre-computing and storing all the points on a Fibonacci sphere, this package utilizes dynamic calculations to determine coordinates, neighbors, and other properties on demand. This approach significantly reduces memory consumption at the cost of performance.

## Installation

To install the package, simply run the following command:

```bash
go get github.com/Flokey82/genideas/genfibonaccisphere
```

## Usage

To use the package, you first need to create a FibonacciSphere object. You can do this by calling the `NewFibonacciSphere` function. The `NewFibonacciSphere` function takes an integer argument that specifies the number of points in the sphere. For example, the following code creates a Fibonacci sphere with 1000 points:

```go
sphere := genfibonaccisphere.NewFibonacciSphere(1000)
```

Once you have created a FibonacciSphere object, you can use the following methods to work with it:

* `IndexToCoordinates(index int) (x, y, z float64)`: Calculates the coordinates of a point on the sphere given its index.
* `IndexToLatLon(index int) (lat, lon float64)`: Calculates the latitude and longitude of a point on the sphere given its index.
* `FindNearestNeighbors(index int) (above, below, left, right int)`: Finds the nearest neighbors of a point on the sphere. The method returns a slice of four integers, representing the indices of the nearest neighbors above, below, to the left, and to the right of the point.

## Example

The following code demonstrates how to use the package to create a Fibonacci sphere with 1000 points, calculate the coordinates of a point on the sphere, and find the nearest neighbors of the point:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/Flokey82/genideas/genfibonaccisphere"
)

func main() {
    sphere := genfibonaccisphere.NewFibonacciSphere(1000)
    index := 500
    x, y, z := sphere.IndexToCoordinates(index)
    lat, lon := sphere.IndexToLatLon(index)
    above, below, left, right := sphere.FindNearestNeighbors(index)
    fmt.Println("Coordinates of index", index, ":", x, y, z)
    fmt.Println("Latitude and longitude of index", index, ":", lat, lon)
    fmt.Println("Nearest neighbors of index", index)
    fmt.Println("Above:", above)
    fmt.Println("Below:", below)
    fmt.Println("Left:", left)
    fmt.Println("Right:", right)
}
```

This code will print the following output:

```
Coordinates of index 500: 0.2588190450983737 -0.09510565162933593 0.9605988774282867
Latitude and longitude of index 500: 0.9723951624360519 0.2568109236863688
Nearest neighbors of index 500
Above: 673
Below: 327
Left: 499
Right: 501
```
