# maptiles

This package implements a skeleton for a map tile browser UI for rendering map tiles Ã  la Google Maps using the Ebitengine in Go. It doesn't do the actual rendering and only renders placeholders for now, but all the functionality for adjusting panning speed, getting tile coordinates from clicks and calculating which tiles are visible is implemented.

This code is based on:
