# gencubesphere

This package will provide means to generate cubemap spheres with an arbitrary number of subdivisions.

Right now this is really experimental and is lacking tangent adjustment etc.

## TODO

- [ ] Implement tangent adjustment
- [X] Add support for finding (closest) face/cell index based on lat/lon
- [ ] Make sure coordinate system is aligned with genfibonaccisphere
- [ ] General feature parity with genfibonaccisphere
- [X] Get neighbors from index
- [ ] Optimize
