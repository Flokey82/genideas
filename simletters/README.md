# simletters

A simple simulation of letters being exchanged between two agents.

The game system would consist of two AI agents, each with its own set of needs, emotions, and values. The two agents would communicate with each other by exchanging "letters" that contain topics they feel strongly about, as well as their emotional state and needs.

The game would have a set of rules and objectives that encourage the two agents to help each other meet their respective needs by addressing the topics that are relevant to them. The topics could range from basic needs such as food, water, and shelter, to more complex needs such as social interaction, personal growth, and fulfillment.

The agents would be programmed to respond to each other's letters in a way that reflects their own needs, emotions, and values. For example, if one agent expresses a strong need for social interaction, the other agent could respond with a suggestion for an activity that would fulfill that need.

As the game progresses, the agents' emotional state and needs would be influenced by the replies they receive from each other. If one agent consistently fails to address the other's needs, that agent's emotional state could become negative, making it more difficult to communicate effectively. Conversely, if both agents work together to address each other's needs, their emotional state could become positive, making it easier to collaborate and achieve their objectives.

To add an element of randomness and unpredictability to the game, the agents could be programmed with varying degrees of emotional stability and flexibility. Some agents might be more rigid in their needs and values, while others might be more adaptable and open to new experiences.

Overall, the game would encourage players to explore different ways of communicating, collaborating, and meeting each other's needs in a complex and dynamic environment. It could be used as a tool for teaching empathy, conflict resolution, and problem-solving skills, as well as for exploring the capabilities and limitations of AI systems.
